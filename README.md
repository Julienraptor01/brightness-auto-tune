# Brightness Auto Tune

Automatically tunes your in-game brightness (gamma) to fit your current sorroundings!

 - when it is dark, your brightness increases
 - when it is bright, your brightness decreases

## Customization

Where is the config screen?

 1. Go to `Mods`
 - You must have [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) installed.
 2. Click `Brightness Auto Tune`, click `Configure...`
 - You obviously must have Brightness Auto Tune installed.
 3. And you're there, congrats!

What can I customize?

 1. `Tune Brightness` - toggle brightness auto-tuning
 2. `Tune Speed` - increase/decrease tuning speed
 3. `Least Brightness` - brightness to aproach when it is dark
 3. `Most Brightness` - brightness to aproach when it is bright

Where is it saved?

`.minecraft/config/brightness-auto-tune.json`

Can I swap `Least` and `Most` brightness?

Absolutely 100% YES!
